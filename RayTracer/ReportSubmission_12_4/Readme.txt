Compilation instructions:
-> Extract the attached RayTracerEnv.zip file.
-> cd into RayTracerEnv\RayTracerEnv\TakeInfinity\.
-> Open TakeInfinity.sln in Visual Studio 2010. All the required files are included with the submission.
-> Run the project.
-> A command window will open which outputs the current pixel being rendered, time stamps, etc.
-> After rendering is complete, press any key to complete the execution and close the command window. [[IMPORTANT]] The project will not write the output to disk without this step.
-> The final rendered image is stored as RayTracerEnv\RayTracerEnv\TakeInfinity\TakeInfinity\render01.ppm.
